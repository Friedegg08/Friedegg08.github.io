<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

I'm a 17 year old high school student. I have a lot of hobbies and like a lot of things. I like to play video games and enjoy most of my time playing sports or games with either friends or family. I can sometimes be talkative but I'm also shy. I like to learn and I work hard when it comes to school. I like to hangout with my friends and enjoy going out.

<h1>My Experiences</h1>
<p>

I recently worked on a project for a college named NYU and our instructor was a NYU student at the time. The project was about working or coming up with a solution about a specific problem within our school. The topic was about how can we help students or let school be a place where students have fun and how to help them improve with school related things. After we gathered infomration, did our research, and came up with a solution, we presented it to the board of the school and it was approved. We enforced it, we would later on do another survey and see if the results would change. When we were done, I got a NYU certificate.
